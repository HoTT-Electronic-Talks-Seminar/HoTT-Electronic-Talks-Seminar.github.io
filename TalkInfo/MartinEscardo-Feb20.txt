Abstract: In previous work, we established results about injective types in HoTT/UF, including characterizations, closure properties, and examples. In recent current work, in collaboration with Tom de Jong, we have developed more examples and counter-examples, as well as a better understanding of the landscape. In this talk I will present these old and new ideas.
