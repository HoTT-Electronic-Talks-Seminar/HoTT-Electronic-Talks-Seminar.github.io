Abstract: I will present an extension of Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory that contains a tiny object; a type for which there is an "amazing" right adjoint to the formation of function types as well as the expected left adjoint. A primary aim of the theory is to be simple enough to be used both by hand and in a (hypothetical) proof assistant. I will sketch a normalisation algorithm and discuss a few potential applications, in particular, to implementations of Cubical Type Theory.
